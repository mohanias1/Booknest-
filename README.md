**BookNest â€“ Where Stories Nestle**

Welcome to **BookNest**, a sanctuary for storytellers and story lovers alikeâ€”a place where tales take flight, memories linger, and imagination finds a home. Just as birds return to their nest for comfort and rest, we believe that stories, too, deserve a place to settle, to be nurtured, and to be shared.

At BookNest, every book is more than just pages and inkâ€”it's a world waiting to be explored. We curate a collection that spans genres, cultures, and generations, offering something for everyoneâ€”from the curious child discovering their first bedtime adventure to the seasoned reader seeking a new literary escape.

Our name reflects our mission: to be a warm, welcoming space where stories are safely cradled and allowed to flourish. Whether you're a passionate reader, an aspiring author, or simply someone looking for a moment of peace between the pages, BookNest invites you to nestle in and discover the magic that only a good story can bring.

This is more than a bookstoreâ€”itâ€™s a home for stories and the people who love them.

**BookNest**: Where stories nestle, and readers belong.

# Book Nest: Full Stack MERN Development Project

## Project Overview

**Book Nest** is a full stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application centered around the concept of a digital library where stories and books can be created, shared, and enjoyed. The platform is designed to foster a community of storytellers and readers, enabling users to nestle their stories safely within a collaborative digital bookshelf.

## Core Features

### User Authentication
- **Sign Up / Log In:** Secure registration and login using JWT-based authentication.
- **User Roles:** Reader, Author, and Administrator permissions for content management and moderation.

### Book and Story Management
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, read, update, and delete their own stories/books.
- **Book Nesting:** Stories can be categorized and organized into collections (nests).
- **Rich-Text Editing:** Authors write stories using a modern, WYSIWYG editor.
- **Cover Images:** Support for uploading cover art for each book or story.

### Social and Community Features
- **Commenting and Reviews:** Readers can comment on or review stories.
- **Likes and Bookmarks:** Users can like stories and save favorites to their personal nest.
- **Following Authors:** Option to follow favorite authors for updates.

### Search and Discovery
- **Full-Text Search:** Discover stories and authors using keywords or tags.
- **Genre Filters:** Browse by genre, length, popularity, or date added.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggested reads based on preferences and reading history.

### Admin Dashboard
- **Content Moderation:** Admins manage user activity, moderate stories, and handle reports.
- **User Analytics:** Dashboard for tracking engagement and growth.
