**BookNest – Where Stories Nestle**

Welcome to **BookNest**, a sanctuary for storytellers and story lovers alike—a place where tales take flight, memories linger, and imagination finds a home. Just as birds return to their nest for comfort and rest, we believe that stories, too, deserve a place to settle, to be nurtured, and to be shared.

At BookNest, every book is more than just pages and ink—it's a world waiting to be explored. We curate a collection that spans genres, cultures, and generations, offering something for everyone—from the curious child discovering their first bedtime adventure to the seasoned reader seeking a new literary escape.

Our name reflects our mission: to be a warm, welcoming space where stories are safely cradled and allowed to flourish. Whether you're a passionate reader, an aspiring author, or simply someone looking for a moment of peace between the pages, BookNest invites you to nestle in and discover the magic that only a good story can bring.

This is more than a bookstore—it’s a home for stories and the people who love them.

**BookNest**: Where stories nestle, and readers belong.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- 
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
